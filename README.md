# Some features of my project
There is a strong authentication system available
User can ask for food if the food will be in available status
The doner can edit delete and deliver the product
JWT has been implemented into this project so, no one can access the data without proper authentication
When the data is delivered successfully no user can see those data again only the doner of that food can see those data in their private page
